WORLD OF MARCEL

Text adventure game in Java language, implemented using Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Visitor, Builder).
Graphic interface implemented using Java Swing.
Used JSON to structure, store, and transmit data.

The game is based on a matrix where each cell may contain the start point, enemies,bonus points, shops or the finish line.
The player has several characters at his disposal and can create as many as he wants 
Each character has unique attributes and abilities. The characters will evolve over time, after each event, gaining experience, quantified by a number. Upon reaching certain quotas,
the player will advance in level, increasing his attributes (power, dexterity, charisma).
If the player is on a store cell, a list of potions that he can buy will be displayed, and if it is on an enemy cell, the options will be displayed: attack the enemy,
use skill, use potion (the fight will be in turns, alternatively, after each choice of the character follows a choice of the enemy.
The game ends when the player finds the final cell or when the player is killed.

I used the Singleton Pattern to restrict the number of instances of the Game class.
At the start of a new game the Factory Pattern will be used to instantiate the characters from the account list.
The Visitor template is used to model the effect that abilities have on entities. 
The Builder creates parts of each complex object when it is called and retains all intermediate states. When the object has all the fields filled,
the user receives the result from the Builder. In this way, greater control is obtained on the construction process of new objects.
